##  Snakes and Ladders

This is a sample project written in Vanilla JS that emulates the game "Snakes and Ladders". It works by rolling a dice every 300ms and moving the pieces forward based on the dice roll.  It will adjust accordingly if it lands on any of the pre-defined snake or ladder squares, and output the results to a HTML page.
