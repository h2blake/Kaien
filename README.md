# Code samples

This is a repo which shows small example projects.

## Wording

This is a sample project based on a fictitious mobile word processing app called "Wording". It's designed to be optimized for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop.  To test out the responsiveness, resize the browser window with the live example located here:

"Wording" uses the following technologies:
* Bootstrap 4
* CSS 3
* HTML 5

##  Snakes and Ladders

This is a sample project written in Vanilla JS that emulates the game "Snakes and Ladders". It works by rolling a dice every 300ms and moving the pieces forward based on the dice roll.  It will adjust accordingly if it lands on any of the pre-defined snake or ladder squares, and output the results to a HTML page.

##  Bracket Match

This is a sample script which takes an array holding several sets of characters comprised of brackets [], parentheses (), and curly braces {}. If each opening character has a corresponding closing character, it is a valid match. If all characters in a given set are considered matching, the set is considered valid. After all sets are compared, an array is sent to console with "YES" for each matching set or and "NO" for each set which was not valid.

##  Secret Santa

This is a small script which imitates the holiday game "Secret  Santa", where, from a group of names, each person is assigned someone to give a gift to. The goal is for each person to give and receive exactly one gift and that person shouldn't be able to give to themselves. At the end of script execution, a list is given which indicates the giver and the recipient.
